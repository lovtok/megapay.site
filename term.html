              is your responsibility to read all Additional Terms to determine whether or not you want to or are eligible

               decisions of the sponsor(s) thereof. The Third Party Outlets are in no way associated with the Promotions

                   <h2>REWARDS PROGRAMS</h2>
        <h3 style="color: var(--gray);">Overview</h3>
        <p>The Site may offer one or more rewards programs ("Rewards Programs") under which you may have the opportunity to earn money and points. Not all of the Site offer Rewards Programs, however, and Rewards Programs may include Additional Terms that apply to your participation in activities allowing you to earn money (collectively, "Activities"). The Company may limit, suspend or terminate your ability to sole discretion that your account contains Fraudulent Traffic, we will void any money, points, Rewards, or potential Rewards you have earned, and we will terminate your account. You agree to abide by the final and binding decisions of the Company regarding any Rewards Program and your participation in it. We reserve the right to change, suspend, or cancel all or a portion of a Rewards Program, including any money and points you may have accrued, at any time. We will generally use reasonable efforts to provide notice to you of any material change to or a suspension or cancellation of a Rewards Program.</p>
        
        <p>Points and money can be earned in a Rewards Program by participating in certain Activities, as described in the Site. If you choose to participate and follow the instructions associated with an Activity, upon satisfying all of the requirements of the Activity, you will be awarded points and money associated with completing that Activity so long as the Company and/or its third-party Rewards Program affiliates are able to properly track your valid and completed point-earning Activities. For avoidance of doubt, Company shall not be responsible for, nor shall Company be obligated to award points, money or Rewards to Rewards Program participants for, any Activity that is not properly recorded, tracked and/or deemed approved under Company's or its third-party Rewards Program affiliates' policies, procedures and systems, and any points, money or Rewards previously granted may be revoked in appropriate circumstances. There may be limitations on Activities and Rewards, so please be sure to review all applicable Additional Terms before deciding whether or not you would like to participate. You agree that we may also contact you by phone, SMS or text (including using an automated dialing system) for the purpose of verifying transactions and/or avoiding potential fraud or misuse of the Site. Some of the limitations on Activities and rewards include (without limitation), our right to change or limit your ability to participate in certain Activities or the Rewards Program itself; our right to change or limit the allowable frequency of Activities; our right to change or limit the number of points and money you can earn for a given Activity or during a given time period; and our right to change the Activities or Rewards available,
             or the number of points required for a particular reward. Points and money awarded have no cash value.</p>
            </div>
 
         <div class="box-99 mb-5">       
             <h3>Redeeming Points</h3>
        <p>You may redeem points you have earned for Rewards offered in a Rewards Program pursuant to these Terms and any applicable Additional Terms. Supplies may be limited. Rewards may be awarded on a first-come, first-serve and while-supplies-last basis. If you attempt to redeem points for a Reward and the Company determines that the Reward is unavailable, out of stock, or for whatever reason cannot be provided to you, the Company may, at its sole and absolute discretion, provide you with a Reward of equal or greater value. No credit, reversal, or refund of points will be issued for any reason after points have been redeemed; in other words, once you order a Reward, you may not cancel the Reward or return the Reward for a refund of points. The only way to use points is to redeem them for Rewards Program Rewards as available from time to time through the Rewards Store. Some Rewards may have eligibility requirements and in that case the Company reserves the right to verify your identity (by requesting photocopy of your driver's license or state ID card, or other proof as we may require) and eligibility qualifications to our complete satisfaction prior to
             crediting points or fulfilling any Reward in any Rewards Program, or otherwise providing you with any benefit.</p>

        <div class="box-99 mb-5">        
            <h3>Rewards Program Points Nontransferable</h3>
        <p>Rewards Program points and money are non-transferable, may not be bartered or sold, and are void if a transfer is attempted, and such points, money and the associated
             Account are not transferable upon death, as part of a domestic relations matter or otherwise by operation of law.</p>

                 <h3>Delivery of Rewards</h3>
        <p>Rewards may be emailed to your email address that you provided when you registered and created an account ("Account") for the applicable Rewards Program, or to the email that our records show your Account was last updated to reflect. Processing times may vary. Rewards that are undeliverable or unclaimed for whatever reason (including, without limitation, 
            because your Account information is incorrect or outdated) may be forfeited, and the points will not be refunded.</p></div>

        <div class="box-99 mb-5">      
              <h3>Inactive Accounts</h3>
        <p>Any Account that has not been logged into and points, money either earned or redeemed for one year or more may be deemed inactive and the Account closed. We may either close the Account completely or remove any points and money in the Account and treat it as inactive, as we elect. In such instances, to request Account reactivation (subject to such terms, limitations and requirements as we may impose from time to time) you may reach us by using the "Contact Us" or similar contact link in the footer of the Site. We may modify the foregoing inactive Account rules and policies in our Rewards Programs from time to time.</p>
        
        <p>Any points and money in our Rewards Programs that have not been redeemed for 
            two (2) years from the time such points were earned or awarded may be deemed expired and removed from your Account. 
            In such instances, to request re-crediting of the expired points and money to the Account (subject to such terms,
